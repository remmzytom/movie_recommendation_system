#### Movie recommendation system


## Scenario
As a movie streaming platform, I want to understand movie trends and user preferences based on movie features, so that I can provide personalized recommendations to my users. The goal is to analyze movie data, uncover patterns in movie ratings, genres, and other key factors, and then implement a content-based recommendation system to suggest similar movies to users.


## What this usecase will teach me
At the end of this use case I will:

Clean and preprocess a movie dataset, including handling missing values.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into movie trends, ratings, and genres
Use machine learning techniques to predict movie ratings based on multiple features.
Visualize patterns in the dataset using data visualization techniques.
Build a content-based recommendation system using movie metadata.

## Introduction
This project aims to explore movie data and develop a content-based recommendation system. Movie recommendation systems are widely used in streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime to enhance user experience by suggesting movies based on their viewing history or preferences. By leveraging a dataset of movies with attributes like genre, ratings, runtime, and brief descriptions, we aim to analyze key factors that influence movie success and develop a system that recommends similar movies based on content.

In this project, we use a dataset containing movies, genres, ratings, and more, to uncover trends in movie success and develop a recommendation system. The content-based recommendation system will utilize features such as genre and textual movie descriptions to suggest similar movies to users based on the attributes of movies they have enjoyed in the past.

The dataset includes information on:

- Movie titles, genres, and release year
- Ratings and number of votes
- Movie runtime and description
- Cast and directors
